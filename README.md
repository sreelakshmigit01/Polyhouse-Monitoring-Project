# Polyhouse Monitoring Project

## Problem Statement

This project focuses on monitoring polyhouse environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, CO₂ levels, and crop yield. The objective is to build a reproducible data science workflow for collecting, processing, analyzing, and modeling sensor data for agritech applications.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to analyze:

* Feature distributions
* Correlation between variables
* Yield relationships
* Potential anomalies

## Generated Visualizations

reports/figures/corr_heatmap_1000.png

reports/figures/scatter_yield_1000.png

## EDA Notes

reports/figures/ were generated using Matplotlib and Pandas to understand relationships among environmental variables and crop yield.

# Feature Engineering

## Features Used

1. temperature_c
2. humidity_pct
3. co2_ppm

## Target

yield_kg

## Scaler

MinMaxScaler

## Outputs

data/processed/features_1000.parquet

models/minmax_scaler_1000.joblib

# Train/Test Split

## Split Method

A chronological 80/20 train-test split was used to preserve temporal order and prevent future information from influencing model training.

## Features

* temperature_c
* humidity_pct
* co2_ppm

## Target

* yield_kg

## Dataset Size

* Total Rows: 979
* Training Rows: 783
* Testing Rows: 196

## Date Range

* Training Period: Earliest records from cleaned dataset
* Testing Period: Most recent 20% of records

## Scaling

MinMaxScaler was fitted on the training data only and then used to transform both training and testing datasets. This prevents data leakage from the test set.

# Linear Regression Baseline Model

A Linear Regression model was trained as an interpretable baseline model for yield prediction.

## Model Features

* temperature_c
* humidity_pct
* co2_ppm

## Saved Model

models/linear_regression_1000.joblib

## Model Performance

| Metric | Value    |
| ------ | -------- |
| MAE    | 0.206 kg |
| RMSE   | 0.253 kg |
| R²     | 0.870    |

## Coefficients

| Feature       | Coefficient |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| temperature_c | 2.8370      |
| humidity_pct  | 1.7381      |
| co2_ppm       | -2.3961     |

## Interpretation

* Temperature shows a positive influence on yield.
* Humidity shows a positive influence on yield.
* CO₂ shows a negative influence on yield in the scaled feature space.
* Linear Regression provides a strong and interpretable baseline model.

# Model Diagnostics

Residual analysis was performed to evaluate prediction errors.

## Generated Figure

reports/figures/residuals_linear_1000.png

## Findings

* Residuals are centered around zero.
* No major nonlinear pattern observed.
* No significant heteroscedasticity detected.
* A few isolated larger residuals were present.

## Diagnostic Report

reports/linear_diagnostics_1000.md

## Recommendation

Linear Regression performs well as a baseline model. More advanced models such as Random Forest Regression can be explored to capture nonlinear relationships and potentially improve predictive performance.
